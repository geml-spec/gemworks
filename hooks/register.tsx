// Gemworks's Claude Code shell. This module runs with no Node and no DOM: from
// the latest policy snapshot it decides whether a tool call can matter to the
// workflow, and asks the bundled CLI (dist/gemworks.mjs: one JSON request on
// stdin, one JSON answer on stdout) only when it can. It never writes a
// project file — journals, .geml/context.geml, the dictionary, the backlog and
// the exports belong to the CLI, which writes them under locks. Gemworks fails
// open: when Node is missing, the bridge fails or times out, or an answer does
// not parse, the call goes through, nothing is recorded, and the band says
// what is wrong; a start that got no answer is tried again by a later tool
// call, prompt or /gemworks, at most once a minute. Each tool call carries the
// directory it starts in, and one that may act in another checkout (a
// worktree, another repository) always goes to the bridge, which attributes
// it to that checkout's work item; the band stays on the session's. A
// main-loop call carries the stage the main loop last read, so an answer on
// another work item (a branch switch, another episode) hands that item over
// in the result. A call no row of the dictionary takes goes through: whether
// it is safe is Claude Code's permission system's call, not the workflow's.
// The one question asked here, with $.ui.ask, is about a tool that is not its
// use's preferred one; the answer goes through the bridge into the dictionary.
//
// What the person sees (spec §8): the band above the prompt — the G mark, the
// words, the one or two actions the moment needs, the pending count — and the
// board's six tabs, each drawn from the pure modules under
// src/hosts/claude-code/ and run through `act`. The settings live in the
// plugin's store; the words follow the chosen language.
